# defdo themes

The theme is a work in progress. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to get in touch with us. 

Feel free to open an Issue or a PR.

We expect support highlights for the following files.

- [ ] Elixir
  - [ ] ex
  - [ ] Heex
- [ ] JS
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] Json
- [ ] Markdown


We appreciate any suggestions.

Our first approach is so complex, but it was achieved in one day, thanks to the generators, but the generators give us extra configurations that are out of our scope.

In the following reviews, I will remove languages that are not part of the list and start with elixir. I will update the readme with the dropped syntax and then, with a mind, clear integrate them if the community requires them.


## Elixir
